# National-Fraud-Detection-and-Accountability-System-
A rule-based fraud detection system designed using computer science principles.

# Project Overview:
NFDAS is a conceptual fraud detection system designed to demonstrate rule-based decision-making, system constraints, and safe handling of edge cases. Detects anomalous transactions, identity theft and unauthorized data changes in real-time. Helps align with POPIA and NIST compliance standards. AI-DRIVEN fraud scoring can integrate with existing systems. This project is a conceptual system design intended to demonstrate analytical thinking, system decomposition, and problem-solving approaches in computer science.

# Problem Statement:
Large institutions continue to suffer major data breaches and procurement fraud (e.g., university systems, public hospitals). Root causes include fragmented systems, poor endpoint visibility, and the absence of unified, tamper-resistant audit trails. These weaknesses enable unauthorized access, delayed detection, and limited accountability.

# Introducing NFDAS 
1. AI-powered anomaly detection. 
2. Secure data auditing.
3. BlockChain-based traceability
4. Endpoint and response correlation

Goal: Real-time prevention and accountability. 

# Architecture Overview
CORE LAYERS:
1. Data ingestion (kafka): secure stream processing. 
2. Processing Engine: AI + ML pattern detection.
3. Storage (PostgreSQL): immutable audit logs.
4. Security Layer: TPM, anomaly monitors
5. Response Layer: Dashboard + Alerts

# Technical Features:
1. Kafka - real-time data ingestion
2. PostgreSQL - secure encrypted logging
3. ELK Stack + Prometheus Monitoring
4. TensorFlow - Pattern recognition
5. TPM Enclaves  - Secure hardware
6. Encrypted Offsite Backups - Data Recovery

These technologies are presented as representative components illustrating how the system could be implemented at scale; they are not claims of a fully deployed production system.

# Integration and Use Cases:
1. Universities  - secure academic and financial data
2. Hospitals - Real-time procurement audit
3. SOEs- National treasury fraud prevention

# How NFDAS Solves the Problem?
1. Detects abnormal data access patterns
2. Continuous Vulnerability Scans
3. TPM ensures device authenticity
4. DLP prevents data exfiltration

# Results and Impact:
1. 90% reduction in fraudulent transactions - Projected impact based on comparable rule-based fraud detection systems.
2. Improved trust and accountability
3. Real-time fraud prevention capability

 # Technical Appendix:
 1. Algorithms: Isolation Forests, Bayesian Inference, Blockchain audit trails
 2. Security: AES-256 encryption,TPM attestation, Zero Trust Access
